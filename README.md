# Miller's Rabin Primality Test

## [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)

## How it works
- Miller Rabin's primality test determines whether a very large number is likely to be prime or not
- It was created in 1976 by Gary Miller
- Its correctness relies in the unproven extended Riemann hypothesis

## Test it
[Here](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/index.php?start=100&stop=110) you can find prime numbers sorted by their number of digits
You can test it with very large numbers like this one, with 300 digits:
```
100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000118000000080101811009000118101080000000811000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
