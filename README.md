## [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)

## How it works
- Miller Rabin's primality test determines whether a very large number is likely to be prime or not
- It was created in 1976 by Gary Miller
- Its correctness relies in the unproven extended Riemann hypothesis
